Lotus poses, Padmasana, is considered by many to be the "classic" yoga pose. Lotus is often used for meditation and pranayama practice.
<br/>
The Sanskrit word for this pose, "Padmasana" (pahd-MAHS-uh-nuh), is named after the lotus flower, or "padma." In the absolute expression, your legs become like the petals of a lotus flower, gently dropping open.

## How To Get There:

**Step 1:** From a seated cross-legged position, ground the hips. Inhale and lengthen through the spine.

**Step 2:** As you exhale, bring the right leg as far out to the right as possible, and close the knee by bringing the thigh and calf together.

**Step 3:** Flex your foot and bring the outside of the right foot to rest in the inner left groin as you inhale. Ensure the rotation comes from the hip and not the knee joint.

**Step 4:** Now pick up the left leg. Pivot the leg from the hip and slide the left leg over the right with your left foot into the right groin.

**Step 5:** Now pick up the left leg. Pivot the leg from the hip and slide the left leg over the right with your left foot into the right groin.

**Step 6:** Draw the knees as close together as is comfortable.

**Step 7:** Bring the backs of the hands to the knees with your fingers in Jnana mudra â€“ thumbs and first fingers touching.

**Step 8:** Keep the spine long. Your Drishti (focus point) is on the floor ahead of you.

**Step 9:** Stay in the pose for ten breaths or longer.

**Step 10:** Come out of the pose the reverse way you came in by carefully uncrossing one leg and then the next. Repeat, starting with the left foot.
