Cauliflower is always best served cooked rather than raw; my favourite is roasted cauliflower. I usually roast it with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and lemon juice. With festive pomegranate jewels, it's a great veggie main.

## Ingredients:

-1 large head cauliflower, core removed and broken into small to medium size

-1/2 clove of garlic, chopped

-1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons olive oil

-1/2 teaspoon Himalayan salt

-2 scallions, chopped

-Juice from 1/2 a lemon

-1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

-Arils from 1/4 - 1/2 a pomegranate

-1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted

-1 tablespoon coriander, chopped

## How To Cook:

**Step 1** Preheat oven to 200C.

**Step 2** Combine cauliflower, garlic, Â¼ cup olive oil, and Himalayan salt in a large bowl. Toss to coat. Transfer vegetables to a baking sheet, single layer, and roast for 20-25 minutes, until cauliflower starts to brown. Once the vegetables are done, transfer them to a bowl and stir with scallions.

**Step 3** Whisk together two tablespoons of olive oil, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard. Pour over vegetables and toss to coat. Arrange vegetables on a platter. Top with pomegranate arils, pine nuts, and coriander. Serve warm.
