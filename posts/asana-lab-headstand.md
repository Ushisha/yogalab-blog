Sirasana, headstand pose, is a symmetrical inversion usually performed at the end of the practice. It is the king of the poses and is said to bring the most benefits.

## Benefits

- Helps relieve stress and mild depression
- Stimulates the pituitary and pineal glands
- Strengthens the arms, legs and spine
- Tones the abdominal organs
- Brings fresh blood to the lower extremities and brain

## How to Get There:

**Step 1:** Kneel on the floor. Bring the forearms to the floor and grab the elbows, ensuring they are shoulder-width apart.

**Step 2:** Release the elbows, interlace the fingers and press the forearms on the floor. Bring the crown of the head to the floor. Open the palms, place the back of the head into the open palms, inhale, and lift the knees off the floor. Straighten the legs and walk the feet close to the elbows.

**Step 3:** Exhale and raise one leg up and then the other. If necessary, bend the knee of the leg on the floor and lightly push off with the foot to hop up. Rotate the upper thighs slightly inwards and press the heels towards the ceiling.

**Step 4:** keep the weight evenly balanced on both forearms. Keep the tailbone lifted and lift the shoulders away from the ears. Once the legs are straight, press up through the balls of the feet. Ideally, hold the pose for three minutes- or longer for more advanced students - but it is vital to building up gradually. Don't strain to hold the pose. Release by bringing one foot down at a time and rest in balasana, child pose for a few breaths.
