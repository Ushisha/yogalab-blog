Yoga Nidra is a form of guided meditation also known as “yogic sleep”. It’s usually practiced lying down with a teacher guiding the session. The practice draws our attention inwards, and we learn to surf between the states of wakefulness and sleep, where our body finds its natural state of equilibrium (homeostasis) – the breath balances and becomes quiet, unconscious and conscious aspects of the mind reveal themselves, and we fall into an innate state of deep, blissful awareness.

## Benefits

- Release tension and pain
- connect with yourself
- improve your sleep and reduce insomnia
- detach from your thoughts

## How to Practice:

**Step 1:** You can lie flat on your back on a yoga mat or a blanket with a bolster or pillow supporting your lower back, spine and your head. Make yourself comfotable as much as possible. You can even put a blanket or pillow under your knees and elbows.

**Step 2:** Set intention and affirmation. Repeat these words 3 times in your head, "I will remain still during the instruction"

**Step 3:** Scan your body. During a body scan, you’ll be asked to focus on certain parts or sensations throughout the body. The goal of this is to help reduce tension so you can relax.

**Step 4:** Become a Witness. Similar to step six, you want to observe your thoughts in the moment without judging or trying to block them out. Should any negative thoughts about yourself surface, think about the positive side of things to ease tension.

**Step 5:** Observe your “self.” Be aware of your personality and how you might be feeling. In other words, your sense of “I-ness.” Then, consider yourself an observing witness. This will help you wake up more aware and in tune with your feelings.

**Step 6:** Reflect on your practice. When you finish, think about how you feel and what you were able to tap into during your session. Then, think about how you can bring the peace or joy you might be feeling into daily life whether times are good or bad. Don’t rush out of your practice. Take a few minutes to transition back into the waking state of life.

Like with most things, don’t give up if you struggle with your first session. Quieting your mind and not doing anything is much harder than you think. So give yoga nidra a few tries. You’ll get the hang of it in no time — especially when your mind and body need time to rest and recover.
