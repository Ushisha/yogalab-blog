Immune-boosting wellness smoothie packed with nourishing ingredients like fresh ginger, turmeric root, spinach, pineapple, banana and black pepper.

This immune-boosting smoothie is excellent for digestion, packs anti-inflammatories and tastes delicious! Enjoy it for a tasty, refreshing breakfast or snack whenever you feel under the weather.

## Ingredients & Benefits

1 frozen ripe banana

1 cup frozen pineapple

2-3 cups organic spinach

1 knob fresh ginger, peeled (about 2 inches of ginger)

1 knob turmeric root, peeled (about 2 inches fresh
turmeric)

1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (or a just couple grinds)

1/2-3/4 cup almond milk or coconut milk

**Banana:** I love using frozen banana to add creaminess to this recipe. It’s packed with healthy carbs and potassium.

**Pineapple:** Pineapple includes a natural enzyme called bromelain, which is wonderful for preventing inflammation and helping poor digestive issues. It also sweetens the recipe nicely.

**Spinach:** I always encourage using spinach in smoothies to get your greens in, because you can’t taste it at all! You can add 2-3 cups to this recipe and get an extra dose of fiber, vitamin and nutrients in all before lunch time.

**Ginger root:** Fresh ginger makes all the difference in flavoring this dish; it also helps with digestive issues, reducing inflammation and even pain.

**Fresh turmeric root:** This is the magic! It’s earthy, incredibly flavorful, and has been used for thousands of years as a medicinal herb. There are numerous benefits of turmeric, which range from increasing antioxidant absorption to even preventing cancer. Turmeric also happens to contain a compound called curcumin, which has powerful anti-inflammatory effects.

**Black pepper:** yes, you’ll need a few shakes of black pepper to release the magic of this immune boosting smoothie! Read up on this below.

**Coconut or Almond Milk:** I typically opt for unsweetened almond or coconut milk, but feel free to use any milk you’d like.

## How to make a creamy smoothie

**1.** **Use frozen fruit.** Frozen fruit is best as it helps the smoothie to be cold and thick. Sometimes ice doesn’t blend well, so it’s best to skip unless necessary. If you only have fresh fruit, add 1 cup of frozen cauliflower.

**2.** **Watch how much liquid you add.** Start with less, and don’t be afraid to add more milk if your smoothie is too thick or won’t thoroughly blend. High-powered blenders tend to blend frozen fruit much better, so if you have a regular or personal size blender, you may need to add more milk.

**3.** **Start low, go high.** Start the blender on low speed, then gradually increase to high to help blend all ingredients. Finally, end with the blender on low speed.
